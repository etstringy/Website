# long version

you may have noticed recently that i’ve stopped using the name “Stringy” on Discord. i’ll explain why.

## 🍋 pomelo

(aka the codename for Discord’s new username system) is the main factor behind all of this. when i heard about the changes my mental plan for username priority was like this:

- mae (HIGHLY unlikely)
- stringy (likely but risky)
- etstringy

when i got around to changing my name, i was met with this delightful screen that i’m sure many of you saw as well:

i already knew “mae” was going to be unavaliable due to me being very very late in rollouts (i made my current account may 2017 and didnt qualify as a nitro user) so i didn’t even bother, but the username “stringy” was also taken unfortunately. 

i actually tried dming the guy with the username just out of the chance that he didnt really care about the username but they wanted to keep it, which i was entirely fine with.

## 🏳️‍⚧️ being myself

before this all occured i had thought about choosing a different username, and even brought it up to a friend.

as it says in the message above, i don’t want to be known as “stringy” on a platform that’s really personal to me. discord is how i communcate with most of my friends and people calling me stringy always feels really weird as if im only representing my artist persona. stringy as an artist identity just feels really corporate to me in the way how i release music and have a logo that i always use and it feels more like an alias or a moniker rather than being myself.

on top of that some may know that “etstringy” is tied to my deadname and as a trans person i’d rather leave that behind than have it integrated into my usernames forever to come

## ⁉️okay wtf is this username then??

my new username is **********vimae**********, and i’ve jokingly decided it means “Very improved mae”. it’s loosely tied to the `vi` and `vim` text editors for linux, which i thought would be a funny reference considering i code a lot. it’s also short (5 letters)

- linux/nerd specific
    
    side note i still need to learn how to actually use vim, i’m still a nano user myself 😭
    

## 🐦 and other platforms?

i’m debating on whever to change my usernames on other platforms, here’s a list of what i’ve decided so far:

### ✅ Discord

see this entire page

### ✅ Mastodon / Calckey (Fediverse)

i’m already known as mae here!
[main (wetdry.world)](https://wetdry.world/@mae)
[alt (f.mae.wtf)](https://f.mae.wtf/@mae)

### ✅ Website

[https://mae.wtf](https://mae.wtf) mentions my music stuff but im not known as stringy on there any more

### ✅ VRChat

my name’s changed on vrchat but is different from vimae

### ❓ Twitter

not too sure about twitter. [vimae is taken](https://twitter.com/vimae) so i wouldn’t be sure as what to put my username as. twitter is another of the places that i be my personal self in rather than my artist so potentially i could make a second account for music stuff and keep my current account as personal?

### ❓ GitHub

undecided yet but probably wont due to compatibility reasons

### ❌ **************YouTube**************

youtube is the home of all my music and where i publish the visuals + visualiser videos i make, username will not be changing there and will be staying as “stringy”. Stringy 2 may be renamed at some point but i dont know right now

### ❌ TikTok

i use tiktok to [promote my music sometimes](https://www.tiktok.com/@etstringy/video/7212278514391747845) so i probably wont change my username there

### ❌ Spotify / Apple Music / SoundCloud

my artist name isnt changing

### ❌ Figma

probably won’t change on figma
