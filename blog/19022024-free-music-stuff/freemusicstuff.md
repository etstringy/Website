over a few years, i've been occasionally asked over discord and wherever by new 
people that want to get into making music on some good free resources for doing so.
this is my comprehensive guide on the best free shit on the internet.

just a disclaimer, of course there's always the option of *sailing the seven seas* for
software, but for legalities sake i won't be covering that here.
**support small developers if you can!**

small heads up, a lot of these free bundles can require accounts for seperate companies
(eg. Native Instruments requires an account to download their launcher) 
so if you're insanely turned off by the idea of that, this might not be for you

## 🖥️ DAWs (digital audio workstations)
due to the huge scope of DAW software, the harsh truth is that it's 
difficult to get something featureful for free. 
there are some free DAWs out there, but generally they lack a lot 
of the features and polish of offerings from more established companies.

if you're looking for a good first option to spend money on, i'd recommend 
[Cockos REAPER](https://www.reaper.fm/). a license only costs $60 and it's a really
good DAW for the price. only issue is that there is a lack of pre-installed plugins

i made a full sheet comparing prices of every major DAW if you're 
intrigued to look for something yourself!

### Free
- [Ardour](https://ardour.org/)
- [LMMS](https://lmms.io/lsp/)
> i've personally found LMMS to be a bit shakey (lack of ASIO audio due to 
> licensing) and only really good for certain types of music (it comes 
> with a lot of chiptune-y instruments!)
- [GarageBand](https://www.apple.com/uk/mac/garageband/) (macOS only)
- [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)
> as of writing Audacity is more of a simple audio editor, but the team
> seems to be working on overhauling it so it might become viable in
> future!
